### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

### Exercise 1

*Trinidad and Tobago has a much higher plastic waste per capita than other countries being nearly 3x as high as the next highest.*

```{r plastic-waste-continent}
# ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)

```

### Exercise 2

```{r plastic-waste-density}
# ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
```

### Exercise 3

Colour and fill are aesthetic and edit how to data looks whereas the alpha variable changed the size of the line therefore it doesn't fit under the aesthetic branch of code but rather under characteristic.

### Exercise 4

Shows the distribution of waste in different countries within the continent whereas, box plots only show the continet's waste as a whole

```{r plastic-waste-violin}
# ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_violin()
```

### Exercise 5



```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged}
 ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
+        mapping = aes(x = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap, 
+                      y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
+     geom_point()
```

+                      y = plastic_waste_per_cap, color = continent)) +
+     geom_point()
